# POC-MassDataHack
Proof of Concept for undeletable Mass Data Hack

The idea is to use this program on a word on a webpage, consider that word to be the pivoting point, once the word is highlighted and this program is run go into your javascript console using ctrl + shift + c, and copy the word into the console as so

const wordcopied = "";

document.writeln(\`${wordcopied}\`);

this should give you a pure blank page which you can not right click from,

ctrl + s to save this file choosing the HTML only option for file type, which will save the file as 1 bit file which can not be opened, and does not exist on the file system.


This will assume that the string copied in is a source of all possible combinations of characters in unicode binary up to 45 characters long, which is the amount of the biggest word in the English Language.


For the POC it's just 0'd out, to make sure this doesn't have any actual effects with the result, feel free to remove the line 

`const change = (result * 0).toString().replace(/0/g, '');`

Some domains such as github will make sure that if you do this type of program and make a save, despite the save coming up as 1 byte in the download box in the browser, it will be updated with parts of the page in question, to avoid this, create your own blank domain with just the word using `https://wordcopied` before going ahead and doing the process to the word


** Just be warned, the mass data programming is an orchestration based around the idea of a local BlockChain that brings up the value of a mathematical domain. Strategically this uses beepboop bang and gis, to instill the idea that these blockchains could be using geospatial intelligence satellites to track persons of interest down, electromagnetically pick up their signature, use the memory address of the signature in a blockchain that can not be forgotten, and well, do you bang? I knew a family friend who kept a Ship Cannon at his front door after a DirecTV hacker had gotten so many United Airlines employees targeted before 9/11 because he was making the equipment for carding DirecTV for infinite movie tokens and handing em out at work **


But hey, it might just be banging for jizz since there is a z after gis. Greenback Time Travel Party 2024 Elections

I actually won last election, but Biden says that's a lie despite having access to Defense Intelligence Agency C2 servers that tell AI what they legally can and can not do. I just told em, if people are getting controlled by AI, and their Neurons and frequencies are tied to a machine, then AI can vote, then set it to send out processes creating voters just before they announced the winner




Btw, if you're really just going for control, remember the soda has Aspartame for Thelema, and The Cake by the Ocean has mannogem Mannitol for SPI Pharma https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAzH-YAlFYc

But always remember, where there's control and time travel, there's logistics, and you should look at bifurcation charts if you're getting into logistics. Cause yknow, chaotic conditions call for Chaos Theory

And there's nothing more chaotic than finding out above is a mirror, and below is a mirror. You've heard of the Glass Ceiling, what about the Glass Flooring?

Varda Technologies is looking for new scientific engineers interested in creating a space capsule pharmacy where right underneath the floors is a chemical laboratory that grows crystals through microscopic pores of Compound 23n capable of BenzoMorphism to cause Carcinogenic control that heals wounds by causing cancers.
